# 📌 Data Projects & ML To-Do List

## 🔨 In Progress
- [ ] **Cost of Living Dashboard** (Numbeo scraping, EDA, dashboarding; potential: regression or clustering)
- [ ] **Pancreatic Cancer Survival Analysis** (classification, survival modeling)

## ✅ Completed
- [x] **Aviation Accident Analysis** – EDA, risk factors, geospatial mapping *(update README)*
- [x] **Terry Stops Legal Analysis** – bias detection, classification *(fix model error)*

## 💡 Upcoming Ideas

### 🧠 Supervised Learning

#### 🔎 Classification
- [ ] **Crime Pattern Classifier in Nairobi**  
  *Use crime type, location, time to classify severity or risk level.*  
  *Data: Open Data KE / Kaggle*

#### 📈 Regression
- [ ] **Uganda Food Inflation Dashboard**  
  *Pull data from World Bank API, model price trends or forecast food inflation.*

### 🔍 Unsupervised Learning

#### 🔗 Clustering
- [ ] **Cluster African Countries by Youth Unemployment**  
  *Group countries based on economic and employment indicators.*

- [ ] **Crime Clustering in Nairobi**  
  *Detect crime hotspots with clustering (KMeans, DBSCAN).*

#### 📉 Dimensionality Reduction
- [ ] *Add PCA/TSNE to any large EDA project (e.g. cancer, aviation) for visualization*

### 💡 Semi-Supervised Learning

- [ ] **Label Propagation on Incomplete Surveys**  
  *Use a real Kenyan survey with missing labels to explore graph-based semi-supervised learning.*

### 🤖 Reinforcement Learning

- [ ] **Simple Supply Chain RL Simulator** *(ambitious)*  
  *Optimize delivery routing or stock levels in a simulated Jumia-style store.*

## 💬 Natural Language / Generative AI

### Chatbots
- [ ] **Kenya Stats Chatbot**  
  *Bot that answers questions about Kenyan economy using World Bank and KNBS data. Finetuned or rules-based.*

---

## 🧪 Creative / Experimental

- [ ] **Jumia Recommender System**  
  *Collaborative filtering or content-based using scraped or simulated product data.*

- [ ] **"Can You Afford It?" Cost Estimator**  
  *User enters salary + city (from Numbeo), get insights into cost of living tradeoffs.*  
  *(Can extend Cost of Living Dashboard)*
